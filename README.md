# Agentic AIOps System for Predictive Maintenance

This project implements an end-to-end predictive maintenance system for smart manufacturing using:
- Temporal Transformer models for failure prediction
- AIOps techniques for monitoring and retraining
- A hybrid rule-based + LLM agent for autonomous decision-making
